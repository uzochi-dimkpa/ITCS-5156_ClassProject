# **Phishing Website Detection by Machine Learning Techniques**

*Final project of AI & Cybersecurity Course*

## **1. Objective:**
A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural nets on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measures and compared.

*This project is worked on Google Collaboratory.*<br>
*The required packages for this notebook are imported when needed.*

## **2. Loading Data:**

The features are extracted and store in the csv file. The working of this can be seen in the 'Phishing Website Detection_Feature Extraction.ipynb' file.

The reulted csv file is uploaded to this notebook and stored in the dataframe.

From the dataset above, it is clear that this is a supervised machine learning task. There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called classification and regression. 

This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this notebook are:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Multilayer Perceptrons
* XGBoost
* Autoencoder Neural Network

"""### **7.1. Decision Tree Classifier**
 Decision trees are widely used models for classification and regression tasks. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision. Learning a decision tree means learning the sequence of if/else questions that gets us to the true answer most quickly.
 
In the machine learning setting, these questions are called tests (not to be confused with the test set, which is the data we use to test to see how generalizable our model is). To build a tree, the algorithm searches over all possible tests and finds the one that is most informative about the target variable.

"""### **7.2. Random Forest Classifier**
Random forests for regression and classification are currently among the most widely used machine learning methods.A random forest is essentially a collection of decision trees, where each tree is slightly different from the others. The idea behind random forests is that each tree might do a relatively good job of predicting, but will likely overfit on part of the data.

If we build many trees, all of which work well and overfit in different ways, we can reduce the amount of overfitting by averaging their results. To build a random forest model, you need to decide on the number of trees to build (the n_estimators parameter of RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier). They are very powerful, often work well without heavy tuning of the parameters, and donâ€™t require scaling of the data.
